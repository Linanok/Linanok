# Multi-stage Dockerfile for the Queue Worker service
# This container runs Laravel's queue worker to process background jobs
# It's optimized for running queue processing tasks in a separate container

# Stage 1: Build Dependencies
# This stage handles dependency installation and build tools
FROM php:8.4-cli-alpine AS build_dependencies

# Install system dependencies required for PHP extensions and build tools

# Install production dependencies only
RUN composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# Stage 2: Production Runtime
# This stage creates the final production image with only runtime dependencies
